# Low-Level Design Showcase

Welcome to my Low-Level Design repository! This project demonstrates my skills in low-level system design, showcasing my ability to create efficient, organized, and scalable code. Although I started this project today, it already reflects my dedication to creating high-quality software solutions. Here's what you can find in this repository:

## Project Overview

This repository is organized to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. Here's a brief overview of its contents:

### Folder Structure


In this structure:

- **TicTacToe:** Contains a basic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.
-  **Logger** Contains a basic implementation of how a Logger works, on the principle of Chain of Responsiblity

## Key Features

- **Modular Code:** Each game (Tic Tac Toe) is encapsulated within its own package, allowing for straightforward expansion or integration into more extensive systems.
- **Object-Oriented Approach:** The code adheres to object-oriented principles, ensuring clean abstraction, encapsulation, and reusability of components.
- **Clear Comments:** The codebase is well-documented with comments to elucidate complex logic and design decisions, facilitating collaboration with other developers.
- **SOLID Principles:** The code follows SOLID principles, fostering maintainability and extensibility as the project evolves.

## Future Improvements

While this project lays a solid foundation, there is room for improvement. In the future, I plan to:

- Implement more advanced game strategies for Chess, enhancing the game's complexity.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to enrich the user experience.
- Incorporate additional low-level design patterns to further optimize the code.

## Conclusion

Thank you for visiting my Low-Level Design repository! I'm excited about the potential of this project and look forward to further enhancing its functionality and performance. If you have any questions or suggestions, please
